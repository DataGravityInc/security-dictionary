####secret key
A cryptographic key that is used for both encryption and decryption, enabling the operation of a symmetric key cryptography scheme. Also, a cryptographic algorithm that uses a single key (i.e., a secret key) for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.

*Related Term(s): symmetric key*
####security automation
The use of information technology in place of manual processes for cyber incident response and management.
####security incident
*Synonym(s): incident*
####security policy
A rule or set of rules that govern the acceptable use of an organization's information and services to a level of acceptable risk and the means for protecting the organization's information assets. A rule or set of rules applied to an information system to provide security services.
####signature
A recognizable, distinguishing pattern. Types of signatures: attack signature, digital signature, electronic signature.
####situational awareness
Comprehending information about the current and developing security posture and risks, based on information gathered, observation and analysis, and knowledge or experience. In cybersecurity, comprehending the current status and security posture with respect to availability, confidentiality, and integrity of networks, systems, users, and data, as well as projecting future states of these.
####software assurance
The level of confidence that software is free from vulnerabilities, either intentionally designed into the software or accidentally inserted at any time during its lifecycle, and that the software functions in the intended manner.
####spam
The abuse of electronic messaging systems to indiscriminately send unsolicited bulk messages.
####spoofing
Faking the sending address of a transmission to gain illegal [unauthorized] entry into a secure system. The deliberate inducement of a user or resource to take incorrect action. Note: Impersonating, masquerading, piggybacking, and mimicking are forms of spoofing.
####spyware
Software that is secretly or surreptitiously installed into an information system without the knowledge of the system user or owner.

####Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM)
The process of identifying, analyzing, and assessing supply chain risk and accepting, avoiding, transferring or controlling it to an acceptable level considering associated costs and benefits of any actions taken.

*Related Term(s): supply chain*
####symmetric cryptography
A branch of cryptography in which a cryptographic system or algorithms use the same secret key (a shared secret key).
####symmetric encryption algorithm
*Synonym(s): symmetric cryptography*
####symmetric key
A cryptographic key that is used to perform both the cryptographic operation and its inverse, for example to encrypt plaintext and decrypt ciphertext, or create a message authentication code and to verify the code. Also, a cryptographic algorithm that uses a single key (i.e., a secret key) for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.
