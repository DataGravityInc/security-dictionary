The term QSA can be implied to identify an individual qualified to perform payment card industry compliance auditing and consulting or the firm itself. QSA companies are sometimes differentiated from QSA individuals by the initialism 'QSAC'.[2]

The primary goal of an individual with the PCI QSA certification is to perform an assessment of a firm that handles credit card data against the high-level control objectives of the PCI Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).
