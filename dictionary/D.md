####data aggregation
The process of gathering and combining data from different sources, so that the combined data reveals new information. The new information is more sensitive than the individual data elements themselves and the person who aggregates the data was not granted access to the totality of the information.

*Related Term(s): data mining*
####data breach
The unauthorized movement or disclosure of sensitive information to a party, usually outside the organization, that is not authorized to have or see the information.

*Related Term(s): data loss, data theft, exfiltration*
####data integrity
The property that data is complete, intact, and trusted and has not been modified or destroyed in an unauthorized or accidental manner.

*Related Term(s): integrity, system integrity*
####data leakage
*Synonym(s): data breach*
####data loss
The result of unintentionally or accidentally deleting data, forgetting where it is stored, or exposure to an unauthorized party.

*Related Term(s): data leakage, data theft*
####data loss prevention (DLP)
A set of procedures and mechanisms to stop sensitive data from leaving a security boundary.

*Related Term(s): data loss, data theft, data leak*
####data mining
The process or techniques used to analyze large sets of existing information to discover previously unrevealed patterns or correlations.

*Related Term(s): data aggregation*
####data theft
The deliberate or intentional act of stealing of information.

####disruption
An event which causes unplanned interruption in operations or functions for an unacceptable length of time.
####distributed denial of service (DDoS)
